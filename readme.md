## üõ†Ô∏è **Project Structure**
The project is split into several key components to ensure maintainability and scalability:
- **`main.py`**: Entry point of the game where all elements come together.
- **`game.py`**: Main game loop that handles the core game logic.
- **`level.py`**: Manages the level design, including loading tiles and handling collisions.
- **`player.py`**: Defines the Player class, focusing on movement, jumping, and interaction.
- **`goblin.py`**: Introduces the Goblin enemies and their behaviors.
- **`base_character.py`**: Abstract class that defines shared characteristics of all in-game characters.
- **`moving_tile.py`**: Implements moving platforms for added gameplay challenge.
- **`tile.py`**: Handles static tiles, like ground blocks or walls.
